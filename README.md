# 2-Digit Up Counter using Verilog

## Overview

Designed the hardware and developed the code for a 2-digit up counter using Verilog. The project involved creating a digital circuit capable of counting from 00 to 99, with outputs displayed on a 7-segment display. This work showcases expertise in digital hardware design and Verilog programming.

## Features

- **2-Digit Up Counter**
  - Counts from 00 to 99.
  - Resets to 00 upon reaching 99.
  
- **7-Segment Display Output**
  - Displays the count on two 7-segment displays.
  
- **Reset Functionality**
  - Resets the counter to 00 when activated.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware Description Language:** Verilog

## File Structure

- `Two_up_counter.v`: Contains the Verilog code for the 2-digit up counter and the testbench.

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to all contributors and those who provided valuable feedback during development.
